// We do not want to run the test when assembling because we prefer to chain the various build steps manually, e.g.
// via `./sbt.sh clean test scoverage:test package packageDoc packageSrc doc assembly`.  Because, in this scenario, we
// have already run the tests before reaching the assembly step, we do not re-run the tests again.

// Comment the following line if you do want to (re-)run all the tests before building assembly.
